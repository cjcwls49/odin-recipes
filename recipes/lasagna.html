    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <P><strong>Lasagna</strong> is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide flat sheets. In
        Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and
        tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and
        seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. The resulting baked
        pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</P>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong> For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and
            parmesan with seasonings. </li>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon
            of
            fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, typically pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make
            from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li>
        <li><strong>Spinach (varition):</strong> Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw
            10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make Lasagna:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil pasta:</strong> In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare meat sauce:</strong> Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta
            sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture:</strong> Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer and bake:</strong> Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until
            the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Important: Let the Lasagna Rest</strong></p>
    Once removed from the oven, let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes (up to 45 minutes is fine, it will
    retain the heat well). This will allow it to thicken up a bit and help it keep its shape when cut. Resting is not
    required when reheating. <p>

    <h2>How to layer Lasagna:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
        <li>Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles
            and sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
